Android Notes:
==============
I tried to install and run Android in VirtualBox on my laptop.
I first installed version 4.3 but it did not work very well and quickly sputtered and died:
- Android43.png shows pretty much how far I was able to get.
- Android43WentDark.png shows my dead VM. I tried restarting multiple times but this did not fix the problem.

I then tried installing Android 2.3 and got farther along.
Android23-X.jpg files detail the progression of steps I took after the installation.
Clearly there is a problem with network connectivity. I have tried different combinations of network settings, including NAT and Bridged Adaptor but without success.
I tried to get help in the Discussion area but there were no responses.
