Buon Viaggio!
=============

It's no secret that I love to travel. I like to think of myself as a citizen of the world. The more you venture out, the more you see that there are different ways of thinking, of acting, of being.

This page highlights some of my adventures with some of my favorite images.

About Me
========

Someone (I don't recall who) said "When you speak another language, you have another soul." I speak four.

When I speak the language of the country I visit, my experiences are so much richer. I make more intimate connections.
